\chapter{Introduction}

The book is a compilation of different, useful and not, lections from the university. The main reason is to create a book, which will be staying on a shelf, and collecting dust. My relatives are saing that the university will be useful and knowledge isn't something you will be carign on my back. I want to prove that it is not a true. The main theme of the book is math and cryptography. Hovewer, there will be a lot of monothone useless chapters of some unrelated subjects, only because it was easy to append. If one want to read a useful book on cryptography, just google some other or choose ``The graduate course in cryptography'' of Boneh et.al. \cite{Boneh2015}. It is a good book.
